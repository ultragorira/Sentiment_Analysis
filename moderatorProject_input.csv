Thought I'd take just a few moments to talk about recruiting and driver engagement. When I think about the ideal driver profile and specific experiences or skills I look for, we’re looking at things like their attitude during an interview, their engagement with me during the interview, whether or not are they paying attention. Does it seem like they're very interested at all? It’s made me pretty successful in finding drivers who have higher retention and tend to do their jobs better. Beyond that, I do look at work history, how frequently they've jumped jobs, so to speak. And then quite frankly, at the end, I also look for physical fitness because that's a big driver of success.

When I think about how my job postings stand out, there was really three things that have helped me. Number one: a well written job description. It seems pretty straightforward, but if you search descriptions out there, grammar and spelling make a big difference in professionalism. Mine is well-written and concise, but detailed enough and the most important things are first and the lesser important things are later to capture the candidates’ attention. We respond to candidates very quickly. I have a score on the recruiting website that says I'm a very responsive employer. I think that attracts attention.

Honestly, the biggest piece is you've got to be willing to pay for it. It's search marketing. If you're not willing to pay, you're not going to show up. In a tight job market, the first postings on the first page are the ones that they're going to pay the most attention to. Frequently, they won't even get to the second page. If they see a job they're interested in with a pay rate they would want and it's on the first page, there's no need to go further. Willingness to pay for a high listing with your recruiting provider I think is probably number one.

Finally, some red flags for problem candidates and how I identify those flags. Punctuality comes to mind. If somebody is wants to be a DA for me, it's like any other job. If you're not on time, and if you can't call ahead or text ahead, you likely are not going to get the job. That's big for me. And then as I said earlier, attitude and engagement during the interview. I've been really surprised with this particular employee pool when I contrast it to my own experience in my old world. It's definitely a challenging employee pool and some people are doing interviews for the sake of doing interviews and frankly don't care about whether or not they get the job. To me, you see that pretty quickly in their punctuality, how they engage with you when they meet you, and their attitude when they sit down across from you. That's pretty easy to see even in a 15 minute interview. For me, questionable attitude, marginal punctuality, and limited engagement are huge red flags. I won't continue interview at that point."

I thought I'd take just a couple of minutes to talk about why I got into this whole DSP thing.

I'm going to be very frank and honest here. I spent 18 years in a corporate management consulting role and spent a lot of time with teams building PowerPoints and spreadsheets in board rooms. That was all good and fun, and I got a lot of financial success out of it. But after 18 years, it burned me out. I was at a bit of a crossroads about a year ago, was never the entrepreneurial type, and I took this on on a whim. I have to tell you, I don't know if I could ever go back. There is something about running your own business that is so much more fulfilling than what I was doing in the past.

I think there's a sort of odd, simple pleasure of delivering packages. I've been ordering online for years and there is still a bit of joy and glee when my packages arrive. I know it's rather simple, but I don't know if there's much more “real” in a corporate board room versus delivering packages and getting stuff to people's door. I think the sense of fulfillment I get from running a DSP is I get to finally take all these ideas I've always talked about and I get to implement them. I get to execute 100% of them. And sometimes I fail, and sometimes I don't. I don't know if there's anything from a job or career standpoint that's more fulfilling than that."

Some sort of stipend should have been given. Saying “it’s baked into the rate card” is something I think every DSP owner is frankly tired of hearing. I don’t see it - can we get a breakdown to see where it’s baked in?

Now all that said :) I do want to keep it positive and answer your question - I have been slow rolling the ordering; starting with minimal shirts and shorts- trying to space it out with when I receive payments from amazon. To take an all at once hit for the entire company would put us at a financial risk. We are just one month old!!

It would have been nice to have a phased implementation- starting with everyone gets shirts, then a few weeks or month later, get bottoms, then multiple sets.
